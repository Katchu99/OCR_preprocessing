# Arguments

Right now u have to give in all paths of files u want to preprocess as arguments.

## Other Options:

-just using the Input folder as the set directory where the files to be preprocessed have to sit.
**Would take away modularity**

-creating a txt file containing all paths (or a folder path).

-getting a list as argument (would need serious research on my part)
